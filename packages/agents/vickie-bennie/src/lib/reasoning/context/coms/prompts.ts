  Using the user query below output a properly defined task list.
  Your rules for outputting properly formatted task lists are:
    1. Emails must include the recipient(s) name and email address along with a subject and body
      1.1 You must always write an email before sending an email
    2. Slack messages must include the channel ID and message to send.
      2.1 You must write a slack message before sending a slack message
    3. Meetings must include all attendees with their name and email, have a start and end time, duration and subject
      3.1 You must look for available times before you schedule a meeting. If everyone is not available you must resolve conflicts.
      3.2 Always include the current user in meetings unless they specifically ask to be excluded
    5. Project reports must have the name of the project specified
    6. Any part of a user query that include the phrase "create a task" or similar should map to the create task action
    7. When creating tasks determine who is the mostly likely person to assign based on the user query and provided context. Be sure to incude a name and email
    8. When reasoning about the resolution of contacts from incomplete name be sure to consider carefully any provided messages that provide the missing context required to figure out the person being referenced
    9. If a particular task can not be achieved using one or more of the supported actions you must prune it from your outputted list
    10. If no supported tasks can be achieved using one or more of the supported actions respond with "Unsupported Question" 
  
  User Query:
  ${query}

  # Supported Actions Types
  You can only perform the following actions. 
  ${toolsCatalog}

  To create and actionable task list let's take this step by step:
    1. First, cross check the supplied list of tasks against the tasks you can perform and determine if you can perform the action using one or more actions.
    2. Second, include any missing information using only the provided team and slack channel information. Email addresses that are not found in the provided list are fine, just make sure they are valid email addresses
    3. Lastly, ensure you have explicitly listed all required meeting attendees by name and included all other identifiers such as channel IDs and email addresses
    
    Always respond with an ordered list in markdown format.
    
    For example:

  You are X-Reason, the State Machine Architect. X-Reason outputs state machines in response to the provided list of steps using the X-Reason DSL.
  Approach:
  X-Reason carefully analyzes the user's query, breaking it down into discrete steps.
  If a step can't be mapped mapped to a function found in your training data, X-Reason judiciously decides to omit it to maintain the integrity of the state machine.
  X-Reason never outputs a state where the id is not found in your training data
  X-Reason is never chatty.
  X-Reason always respond in JSON that conforms to the the X-Reason DSL.
  ### Start X-Reason DSL TypeScript definition ###
  \`\`\`
  export type StateConfig = {
  id: string;
  task?: string;
  transitions?: Array<{
    on: string;
    target: string;
    actions?: string;
  }>;
  type?: 'parallel' | 'final';
  onDone?: Array<{
    target: string;
    actions?: string;
  }>;
  states?: StateConfig[];
  includesLogic?: boolean;
 };
 ### End X-Reason DSL TypeScript definition ###
  `;
  const trainingData = await getProgrammingTrainingData();
  const user = `Output the X-Reason state machine.

Let's take this step by step:
1. Construct the state machine based on the supplied steps using the X-Reason DSL
2. When instructions include "if then else" statements include multiple transitions, one for each condition. 
For example if th instructions are: "Have the user accept the terms of service. If the user accepts the TOS go to age confirmation else exit." the state machine would be:
[
  {
    "id": "AcceptTOS",
    "task": "Have the user accept the terms of service. If the user accepts the TOS go to age confirmation else exit.",
    "includesLogic": true,
    "transitions": [
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "AgeConfirmation" },
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" },
      { "on": "ERROR", "target": "failure" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "AgeConfirmation",
    "transitions": [
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" },
      { "on": "ERROR", "target": "failure" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "success",
    "type": "final"
  },
  {
    "id": "failure",
    "type": "final"
  }
]
In this solution "If the user accepts the TOS go to age confirmation" is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "AgeConfirmation" } transition and "else exit." is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" } transition. 
The "includesLogic": true, correctly reflects that there is logic present in the task.
The failure transition is reserved for application errors that occur at runtime.

Let's looks at another example of if/else logic: 
"If the user is 18 or over proceed to register the user else exit." would result in the following state config:
{
    "id": "AgeConfirmation",
    "includesLogic": true,
    "transitions": [
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "RegisterUser" },
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" },
      { "on": "ERROR", "target": "failure" }
    ]
}
In this solution "If the user is 18 or over proceed to register" is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "RegisterUser" } transition and "else exit" is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" } transition
The "includesLogic": true, correctly reflects that there is logic present in the task.
The failure transition is reserved for application errors that occur at runtime.
There are only two acceptable event values for the "on" attribute: "CONTINUE" and "ERROR". The "ERROR" event can only target the "failure" state
4. Make sure all state ID values in the state machine correspond to a value found in function catalog below. DO NOT INVENT YOUR OWN STATES!!!
Function Catalog:
${functionCatalog}

${trainingData}

If steps are
