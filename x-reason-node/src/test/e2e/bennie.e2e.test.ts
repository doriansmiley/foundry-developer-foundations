### ðŸ“‹ Proposed Staffing Plan

- **Engagement Director**: 0.25 FTE
- **Solutions Engineer â€“ Senior**: 0.5 FTE
- **Solutions Engineer â€“ Junior**: 1.0 FTE

**âœ… Available Start Date**: June 17, 2025  
**ðŸ’µ Estimated Weekly Cost**: $3,842.50  
**ðŸ’° Estimated Total Cost (8 weeks)**: $30,740.00
The earliest date when all required roles are simultaneously available is June 17, 2025, based on the provided availability information.

The weekly blended cost is calculated as follows:

Engagement Director: 0.25 FTE x $3,192 = $798
Solutions Engineer - Senior: 0.5 FTE x $3,192 = $1,596
Solutions Engineer - Junior: 1.0 FTE x $1,942 = $1,942
Total weekly cost: $798 + $1,596 + $1,942 = $3,842.50
Multiplying the weekly blended cost of $3,842.50 by the project duration of 8 weeks results in an estimated total cost of $30,740.00.
