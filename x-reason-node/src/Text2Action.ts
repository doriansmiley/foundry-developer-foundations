            RFP to Northslope: Request sent successfully! They acknowledge receipt and will respond shortly. Receipt ID is 466eeb1d-435c-4062-9890-508e957344f5.
            RFP to Rangr Data: Request sent successfully! They acknowledge receipt and the solution details appear to be valid. Receipt ID is fe655407-8a48-4ef7-808f-f7a341cfdbae.
            Awaiting Responses: We're still waiting for both Northslope and Rangr Data to submit their complete RFP responses.
            Let me know if you need me to chase them up or do anything else!

            Your RFP for Northslope using ID: northslopetech.com was sent and we received the following response from their agent:
            ### 📋 We Can not process your request
            We can not process your request without a valid start and end date
    
            And the incoming message is:
            The sart date is June 3rd and the end date is june 25th
    
            Your response is:
            {
                "action": "Resubmit RFP to resolve missing information" , 
                "emailAddresses": [],

                "message": "Create RFP - Vendor: Northslope <northslopetech.com> - Objectives: Deliver a tariff solution on Foundry that includes support for pricing models, simulations, and A/B testing of the outcomes for John Doe's Manufacturing at 123 main street dallas tx, 75081 with contact johndoe@johnsdoes.com - Deliverables: A fully functional tariff solution on Foundry. - Timeline: 4 week engagement starting Jun 3 2025 and the ending Jun 25 2025 requiring 3 Python engineers, 1 TypeScript engineer, and 2 SMEs on developing pricing models.",
